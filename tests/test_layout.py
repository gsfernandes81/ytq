"""Every line these screens draw has to fit the terminal it is drawn on.

The floor is 32 columns, and a line that does not fit is never a cosmetic
problem here: what gets clipped off the end of a hint line is the way out of
the screen, what gets clipped off a notice is the fix, and what gets clipped
off a feed line is the price of the key above it. So the widths are a property
and not a spot check — every layout is measured across the whole range, with
the content a phone actually gets.
