# The checks: the pytest suite, one runner, one copy.
#
#     .githooks/checks.sh        run everything
#     make check                 the same thing
#
# The pre-push hook runs this and refuses the push on a failure — a push is a
# deploy here: the phone pulls it and the nightly runner runs what landed.
#
# Offline: no network, no scheduler. Needs the sibling checkouts (dlq — and
# zwana-quota, which dlq's runner imports — beside this one or under ~),
# because the modules import across them the same way a real run does.
#
# The front ends lay out to the terminal and check every line fits it down to
# 32 columns, so these fail on a long checkout path — that is the path, not a
# regression: run them from a shallow clone (~/ytq is what they are built for).
#
# The old per-module self-tests were removed on 2026-09-02 to be rebuilt as a
# pytest suite. Until that suite lands, tests/ is empty and pytest exits 5
# ("no tests collected") — which is reported here as "no tests yet" and passed,
# so the interim commits are pushable. The suite tightens this.
