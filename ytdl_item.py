"""yt-dlp as an expiring-quota queue item: one slice a firing, resumed natively.

Why this is not :mod:`expire_dl`
-------------------------------
The obvious shape is ``yt-dlp -g`` to resolve a direct media URL, then hand that
to :mod:`expire_dl` and let its bounded-Range machinery do the rest. That shape
**breaks across nights**: YouTube's media URLs are signed and expire in about six
hours, so a download spanning two nights resumes against a dead link.

So the item runs yt-dlp *itself* on every firing. Each firing re-extracts a fresh
URL and yt-dlp resumes its own ``.part`` from ``os.stat`` — the same append-only
prefix argument :mod:`expire_dl` makes, just enforced by yt-dlp. The cost is one
metadata extraction per firing (~0.1-0.5 MB) and a less precise slice edge: no
server stops us at a byte boundary, we watch the file grow and stop the child.

What holds the guarantees
-------------------------
Not this module. The runner's guards are unchanged and unconditional — ≥100 MB
left afterwards, nothing past 00:00 UTC, the paid reserve never touched — and
they are enforced against the *interface counters*, so they hold however an item
behaves internally. This module only tries to stop early enough that those
guards are never the thing that stops it, because a cooperative stop leaves a
resumable ``.part`` and a SIGKILL mid-write may not.

Byte metering
-------------
Bytes taken this slice are measured from ``.part`` files on disk, not from
yt-dlp's progress output. Two consequences worth naming, because both are the
reason the rule is shaped this way:

* **Only names containing** ``.part`` **are counted.** Merging writes a new file
  the size of both inputs; metering the directory would read that as a second
  download of the whole video and stop the item mid-merge, every night, forever.
* **Sizes are per-file high-water marks.** A finished stream is renamed out of
  ``x.part`` to ``x``, and a plain sum would read that as bytes being handed
  back.

Postprocessing (merge, fixup, thumbnail embed) does no network I/O, so when a
postprocessor announces itself the byte budget stops being enforced — otherwise
a video that finished downloading at the slice edge could never be merged.

Usage from a queue item::

    sys.path.insert(0, "/data/data/com.termux/files/home/or3/termux/expire")
