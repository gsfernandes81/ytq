"""Find a video and queue it for the expiring-quota runner, at a measured size.

``EXPECT_BYTES`` is the cap the runner enforces against an item, and the queue
contract says plainly that "unknown" is not a valid answer for it. Guessing it
from a resolution is how an item ends up either refused every night for being
too big or killed by the interface watchdog for being bigger than it claimed.

So this asks yt-dlp. Paste a URL, it runs a metadata-only extraction (~0.1-0.5 MB
of internet data and no media), lists every format with the size yt-dlp reports
for it, and writes a queue item with that figure already in the header. The
number in the item is then a measurement with a stated overhead margin, not an
estimate.

It also searches. One flat search is a single request (~0.1 MB) that answers
with a title, a channel, a length and an approximate age per result; picking one
probes it exactly as a pasted URL would. The entry field takes either, and tells
them apart by looking, so there is one box rather than two.

And it browses the subscription feed, which is the same list of the same things
and so is the same screen: ``subs`` in that one field asks YouTube for the
newest ``SUBS_RESULTS`` videos from the accounts you follow, bounded to one page
(~0.2 MB), marked with what the queue already holds, and picked from exactly as
a search result is. It is the one thing here that needs the *stored cookie* —
the jar the yt-dlp config already points at for the bot check — so whether there
is one is asked before a request is spent rather than after one comes back
empty. An empty feed is never reported as "nothing new": YouTube answers a
logged-out feed with no entries rather than with an error, so that answer means
the cookies have expired and the screen says so.

Usage::

    ytq                      # search, or paste a URL into the same field
    ytq crust of rust        # straight to the results
    ytq subs                 # straight to the subscription feed
    ytq <url>                # straight to the format list
    ytq --list <url>         # print the formats, write nothing
    ytq --list --subs        # print the feed, write nothing
    ytq --now <url>          # open the format list ready to download now

The item it writes runs yt-dlp per firing (see :mod:`ytdl_item`); it never
resolves a media URL up front, because those are signed and expire in hours,
which is shorter than the queue takes to work through a large video.

Downloading now still writes that item first and then asks ``dlq`` to run it,
rather than waiting for the window. Downloading without the queue would have
been less code and worse: this way an interrupted download resumes instead of
restarting, the nightly window finishes anything that stops early, and
``dlq list`` knows about it like everything else. It is mobile data spent now,
though, which the nightly window is not.

That run is handed to a detached process rather than held in the foreground, so
choosing it does not end the session: the screen goes back to the results with
the download reporting its progress along the bottom.

    Below :data:`WIDE` each result takes two lines, so ten of them are ten
    titles a thumb can read rather than twenty truncated columns. The cursor
    reverses both lines of the one it is on; ``✓`` is the only other mark, and
    only on what this session has already queued.

    One screen for the search results and the subscription feed, because they
    are the same list of the same things and everything below them — the
    duplicate marks, the format screen, the confirmation — takes a
    :class:`Result` and does not care where it came from. *feed* changes the
    four things that are genuinely different: what the banner calls it, that
    the listing has an age worth saying (*fetched*), that the middle key reads
    it again instead of searching again, and that there is more of it to be
    bought (*more*, the total a deeper look would ask for, with *at_cap*
    telling the two ways of having none apart — see :func:`next_page`).

    The title under the cursor scrolls when it does not fit. The screen only
    wakes up to do that while there is actually something scrolling, so a list
    of short titles still blocks on the keyboard and costs nothing at all,
    which is the property this loop was written for in the first place.

    *place* is handed back with the answer rather than kept here, because
    every way out of this screen comes back to it: queueing a video redraws
    the list, and a deeper look and ``r`` fetch and redraw it. Starting at the
    top each time turned "find three things to download in one search" — which
    is what this screen is *for* — into three scrolls back to where you were,
    and made the deeper look useless past the first page.

    ``←`` and ``→`` jump a screenful, the same as page up and page down and
    for the same reason those are here: a feed read deeply runs to
    :data:`SUBS_MAX`, and on a phone the page keys are two taps into an
    extra-keys row that the arrows are already on. Neither pair is in the
